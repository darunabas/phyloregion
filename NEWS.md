# Changes in version 1.0.3

* Removed `plot_evoldistinct` because the functionality is replaced 
with `plot_swatch`.

* `plot.phyloregion` and the generic `plot` function are now exported and both 
produce the same result. 

* Changed title to "`phyloregion`: R package for biogeographic 
regionalization and macroecology"

* Improvements in the vignettes with several examples.


# phyloregion 1.0.0

* This is the first CRAN release of phyloregion.
