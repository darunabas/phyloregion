#' Biogeographic regionalization and spatial conservation
#'
#' This R package is for analysis of biogeographic regionalization (the
#' classification of geographical areas in terms of their biotas) and spatial
#' conservation in the R scientific computing environment. Previously it was
#' only possible to perform analysis of biogeographic regionalization on small
#' datasets, often using tools that are difficult to replicate. With
#' macroecological datasets of ever increasing size and complexity,
#' `phyloregion` now offers the possibility of clustering large-scale species
#' distributions combined with phylogenetic information using sparse matrix,
#' determining optimal number of clusters, quantifying evolutionary
#' distinctiveness of bioregions, and visualizing patterns and underlying
#' processes. It is simple, fast, and particularly tailored for handling large
#' datasets.
